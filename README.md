# LINES-PORTS

Here lies ports of my game [LINES!!!](https://github.com/Rabios/LINES),All ports written by me.

## List of ports

1. HTML5 and Mobile port,Ported using my HTML5 game framework [Pancake](https://github.com/Rabios/Pancake),Port source is in `web` branch.
2. Linux port,Using [Astie Teddy's raylib Lua binding](https://github.com/TSnake41/raylib-lua), Port source is in `linux` branch.

## NOTES

1. Linux port source code works on Microsoft Windows
2. You can still [compile original C source code of LINES!!!](https://github.com/Rabios/LINES) and run on Linux,You can also compile it for other platforms like Android (It's working %100),But unfortunately no Makefile.   
3. Original C version not tested on Mac (But should works %100),I don't own a Mac.
5. Web and Mobile port of the game is client based,You can run it offline.
6. You can't move player in web port,Just tap to teleport player.
7. Web based issue might faces Android users only which is when tap and hold for long time and game doesn't respond to input then,So tap fast.
8. Instead of original C version,The GUI here are textures drawn.
9. Although these ports working %100,I still recommend compiling C source instead of the ports.
